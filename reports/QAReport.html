     <h3> What does Quality Assurance mean for web site development? </h3>
        <p>  Quality Assurance (QA) ensures that end-users get a 
            functional user interface and the best user experience when 
            using a web app or website. It examines a website or web 
            application to try and uncover any flaws that might have been 
            overlooked during design and development. </p>

    <h3>Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time."</h3>
        <p>Quality assurance includes two principles: "Fit for purpose" 
            (the product should be suitable for the intended purpose); 
            and "right first time" (mistakes should be eliminated). 
            QA includes management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, 
            products and components, services related to production, 
            and management, production and inspection processes.</p>

            consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. 
            Without getting technical, simply it's the guideline for 
            the mark-up language which determines how a web page. 
            displays in a visitor's browser window.</p>

            or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with
