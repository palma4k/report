            <h2>Short Answers To Research Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is an internet domain name?</h3>
              <p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. .</p>
              <p>In general, a domain name identifies a network domain, or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, 
                a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet.</p>

            <h3>Why are domain names so important on the web?</h3>
              <p>On a basic level, domain names are important because the Internetâ€™s addressing scheme is not very effective without them.</p>
              <p>Each computer on the Internet has an Internet protocol (IP) address: a unique string of four numbers separated by periods, 
                such as 165.166.0.2. Since remembering the IP addresses of all of your favorite Web sites would be nearly impossible, 
                a group of computer scientists created the domain name system to assign a unique name to each numeric IP address.</p>

              <h3>Why do domain names have to be unique?</h3>
              <p>The domain name has to be unique to ensure that no two parties hold the same domain name as this can create a problem 
              and will defeat the purpose of building your brand identity. </p>

              <h3>What does it mean to register a domain name?</h3>
              <p>Registering a domain name means mapping the domain name to IP address(es) and other information associated with the domain 
              in the DNS (Domain Name System) </p>

              <h3>If you wanted a domain name that is already taken, how could you get it?</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Register the domain name with a different extension if it is available (i.e. .net instead of .com)</li>
                <li>Wait for it to expire and register it when it becomes available</li>
                <li>Buy it from the current owner</li>
              </ol>
