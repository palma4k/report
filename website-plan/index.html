    <h2>Site Personality</h2>

         <p>This site personality will be basicaly, a personality of an introvert, as well as an extrovert.
             the reason I say that, is because, with music, you can be either shy or outgoing, and become a 
             great musician. When you leave this website, you'll want to go want to the music store, and 
             going to want to but your self a <Strong>bass</Strong>, and start learning how to play, 
             to impress not only yourself, but others.
         </p>

         <h2>Limitations</h2>
         <ul>
             <li>For simply a bass player or some musicians, when something isn't working, we tend to find different venues to
             start jamming faster. so, most likely they might have fast internet, and newer computers, also mobile devices. 
             Therefore, they will be accessing the information from their phones. </li>
