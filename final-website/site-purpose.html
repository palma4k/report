            <p>The purpose of this site is to gather musicians and people alike, that are willing
            to learn some skills on how to play togehter. Also, what is it like to jam or to have jam
            seessions? This is a place to go on line, also, to find a place to meet offline, to play 
            or jam with people that want to have fun with music. 
            The reason why this site is being created, is because, I see the need of unite Muisicians, 
            or people that want to learn, how to express their feelings with music. In a world that 
            no one can understand how one feels inside, nor how an individual can express themselves with words.
            I've found that when I grab an instrument, I get lost into the music with my intsrument.
