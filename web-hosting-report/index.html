<h2>"Research Questions"</h2>
<hr>
	<ol>
		<li>What is a web server (Links to an external site.)? Why would you need one?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>A web server is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">server software</a>, or hardware dedicated to running said software, 
			that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, 
			contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests 
			over HTTP and several other related protocols.</li>
				
			 
			<li>The reason why we need a server, is the same as why we need a hard drive in our computers.
			Then we can store our information, pictures, and what not. The server is where we can store our
			website link, <Strong>URL</Strong>, whoever we decide to go with as for a domain, that would be 
			the host, and they will be the ones having the server. Then, whoever acces the link for our website,
			can easily view it, because it's store in the host's server. </li>
			
		</ul>

		<li>Explain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</li>
				
		<ul>
			<li> The reason for that is because, you have to pay for space of your content. 
				some domain companies will sell you domain space for really cheap, but they will get you on how much 
				space they sell you. Reason why you need a server. </li>

		</ul>
		

		<li>What service does a website hosting company (Links to an external site.) provide?</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals 
			to post a <a href=https://www.website.com/beginnerguide/webhosting/6/1/what-is-web-hosting?.ws">website</a> or web page onto the Internet. 
			A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies
			and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet. 
			Websites are hosted, or stored, on special computers called servers. 
			When Internet users want to view your website, all they need to do is type your 
			website address or domain into their browser. Their computer will then 
			connect to your server and your webpages will be delivered to them through the browser. 
				</li>
			</ul>

		<li>What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</li>

		<ul> 
			<ol TYPE= "A"> 
			<li>Solid/Reliability. Every time your web site goes down, so does your number of visitors </li>
			<li>Speed.</li>
			<li>Space</li>
			<li>Substantial Bandwidth.</li>
			<li>Support.</li>
			<li>Superior Features & Technology.</li>
			<li>Sufficient Email.</li>
			<li>Secure Location.</li>
			</ol>	
		</ul>



		<li>Research companies (Links to an external site.) that provide website hosting plans. On average,
		    what is the price range (price per month) for hosting a website?</li>
